# Moodie - Digital Teaching Assistant

Moodie is the final project for my BA in Instructional Technologies, it was built together with my colleague 
Dolly Gotie Shavit.

Moodie is an artificial intelligence based chatbot in the Hebrew language, which is integrated into the e-learning environment and serves as a teaching assistant.

Moodie was developed in collaboration with the Faculty of Instructional Technologies at the Holon Institute of Technology. Our main goals were to help students receive an immediate and relevant answer to their questions, and to help the academic staff in reducing the workload they face.


Moodie was developed to provide students with answers to concepts and ways of applying the material learned during the courses, and to allow them a personal interface where they can feel comfortable asking questions about the content worlds learned, even if it's a question the student may not be comfortable asking in another forum. 

On the other hand, Moodie allows lecturers and practitioners to be exposed to questions that arise in the student interface with the chatbot, and to monitor the learning process of the chatbot - to ensure that the database contains as accurate and tailored information as possible for the target population.



## Students Interface
The chatbot interface is responsive and adapted to most technological devices (smartphones, tablets and different sizes of computer screens).
The chatbot supports displaying images.

## Lecturers Interface 
The editing interface has four pages through which the academic staff can update the database, examine the topics on which the students ask questions, train Moodie to be precise and monitor the information on which the model is training.

The four pages are:
1. Add Question - allows the lecturer to manually add a question and answer to the chatbot's Q&A database.
2. Publish Questions - displays the questions asked by the students alongside the answers given by the chatbot. Questions can be added to the chatbot Q&A database by checking them and clicking the 'Train Chatbot' button.
3. Delete from Database - displays the existing chatbot Q&A database after performing the chatbot training. Questions can be deleted from the database by checking them and clicking the delete button.
4. Reset Database - resetting the database to its initial settings and deleting all the questions and answers that the chatbot were trained with.
